###Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Software Engineer whoâ€™s been everywhereâ€”service companies, product orgs, and the freelancer jungle.

I build UI beasts with React, Vue, and Alpine.jsâ€”so intense your CPU might file for overtime pay. ðŸ”¥

My mission? Make hardware sweat, users smile, and DOMs tremble. Letâ€™s turn chaos into creativity (and maybe break a few benchmarks while weâ€™re at it). ðŸš€
