Hello there! 👋
I’m a Software Engineer with experience across service-based companies, product-based organizations, and yes, even the freelancer wildlands.

💻 What keeps me going?
I love building super complex user interfaces with React, Vue, and Alpine.js—the kind of UIs that make your CPU say, "Oh no, not again!" 🖥️🔥

My goal? To make your hardware sweat while keeping your users smiling (and maybe scratching their heads, just a little). Whether it’s squeezing every drop of performance or bending the DOM to my will, I’m here for the chaos and the creativity.

🚀 Always open to challenges, collaboration, and maybe a cup of coffee or two to keep things rolling!
